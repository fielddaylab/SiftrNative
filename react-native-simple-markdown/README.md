A component for rendering Markdown in React Native with native components, working with both iOS & Android. Pull requests are welcome üòÉ üéâ!

## Getting started

`yarn add react-native-simple-markdown`

## Future

If you've been using this lib for a short/long time or are interesting in shaping it for the future: [just chime in and share your thoughts with us](https://github.com/CharlesMangwa/react-native-simple-markdown/issues/75)!

## Usage

All you need to do is import the `react-native-simple-markdown` and then use the
`<Markdown />` component.

```js
import React from 'react'
import Markdown from 'react-native-simple-markdown'

const MyAwesomeApp = () => {
  return (
    <Markdown styles={markdownStyles}>
      #Markdown in react-native is so cool! {'\n\n'}

      You can **emphasize** what you want, or just _suggest it_ üòè‚Ä¶{'\n'}

      You can even [**link your website**](http://carlito.ninja) or if you prefer: [email somebody](mailto:email@somebody.com){'\n'}

      Spice it up with some GIFs üíÉ:

      ![Some GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/dkGhBWE3SyzXW/giphy.gif){'\n'}

      And even add a cool video üòé!{'\n'}

    </Markdown>   
  )
}

const markdownStyles = {
  heading1: {
    fontSize: 24,
    color: 'purple',
  },
  link: {
    color: 'pink',
  },
  mailTo: {
    color: 'orange',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#555555',
  },
}
```

## Properties
### `styles`

`<Markdown />` will apply its style by default. However you can pass a `styles` prop to customize it has you wish.

Example:

```js
<Markdown
  styles={{
    heading1: {
      fontSize: 20,
    },
    strong: {
      fontWeight: 'bold',
    }
  }}
>
  #Hello üëã
</Markdown>
```

### `rules`

Here again, `<Markdown />` will apply its rules by default. However you can pass a `rules` prop to add your own and then customize how the Markdown elements will be displayed!

Example:

```js
<Markdown
  rules={{
    image: {
      react: (node, output, state) => (
        <CustomImageComponent
          key={state.key}
          source={{ uri: node.target }}
        />
      ),
    },
  }}
>
  ![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)
</Markdown>
```

RNSM also allows you to remove easily unwanted styling options without having to pass in rule objects that have their react key implemented/dummied to ignore those styling options.

Example:

```js
<Markdown
  styles={ markdownStyles }
  whitelist={['link', 'url']}
>
  { description }
</Markdown>
```

`whitelist` will only apply `link` and `url` default styles, while `blacklist` will do the opposite. You don't need to pass in a rules prop that contained a key for all the styles you don't want and reimplement their styling output anymore.
